This directory contains system tests, which can be run against the btg
daemon.

The tests use btgcli, and should therefore be used _after_ btgcli was
built.

Test procedure
--------------
1. Generate daemon/client config. Execute gen_btg_config.sh.
2. Open one terminal, execute ./run_daemon.sh.
3. Open another terminal, execute one of the tests.

Tests
-----

test_btgpasswd.sh       - add/modify an user.

                          different commands. [1]
